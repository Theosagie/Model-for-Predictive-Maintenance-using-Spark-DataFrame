# Model-for-Predictive-Maintenance-using-Spark-DataFrame
The aim of the project is to classify whether there is a fault with a machine based on the readings from vibration sensors. The project utilizes the MLlib library in Spark to train four classification models while also using MLflow to track the experiment and monitor the model's performance
